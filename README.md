## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside

This repository includes implementations of fundamental data structures such as:

- **Arrays / Dynamic Arrays**  
- **Linked Lists** (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- **Stacks & Queues**  
- **Trees** (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL, etc.)  
- **Heaps / Priority Queues**  
- **Hash Tables / Maps**  
- **Graphs** (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)  
- **Tries / Prefix Trees**  
- **Others** (e.g. Disjoint Set / Union-Find, Segment Tree, etc.)

Each implementation includes basic operations (insert, delete, search, traversal, etc.) and sometimes test files or example usage.
